# Blue-Green Deployment System - Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

A single binary application that manages blue-green deployments for multiple containerized applications across VMs, providing zero-downtime deployments with connection draining and health checking.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Deployment Management
- **REQ-001**: Support multiple applications per binary instance
- **REQ-002**: Maintain blue and green container instances per application
- **REQ-003**: Perform zero-downtime deployments with connection draining
- **REQ-004**: Support WebSocket connections with hard timeout cutoff for draining
- **REQ-005**: Automatically pull new Docker images when deployment is triggered
- **REQ-006**: Perform health checks before promoting containers to active state
- **REQ-007**: Automatically rollback (not promote) if health checks fail

### 2.2 Configuration Management
- **REQ-008**: Load application configurations from YAML files
- **REQ-009**: Support per-application Docker container configuration (env vars, volumes, memory limits)
- **REQ-010**: Configure separate ports for blue/green containers and proxy
- **REQ-011**: Define health check endpoints and parameters per application
- **REQ-012**: Set connection drain timeouts per application

### 2.3 Reverse Proxy
- **REQ-013**: Act as reverse proxy for HTTP and WebSocket traffic
- **REQ-014**: Preserve all HTTP headers including cookies, user IP, host information
- **REQ-015**: Add standard forwarded headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, etc.)
- **REQ-016**: Listen on separate ports per application
- **REQ-017**: Route traffic to active (blue or green) container
- **REQ-018**: Handle WebSocket upgrade requests and bidirectional proxying

### 2.4 Health Checking
- **REQ-019**: Perform HTTP-based health checks on configurable endpoints
- **REQ-020**: Support configurable timeout, interval, and retry parameters
- **REQ-021**: Track health check history and response times
- **REQ-022**: Only promote containers that pass all health checks

### 2.5 Integration
- **REQ-023**: Provide HTTP API for triggering deployments (s3dock integration)
- **REQ-024**: Accept deployment requests via local HTTP endpoint
- **REQ-025**: Update desired image version via API calls

### 2.6 Data Persistence
- **REQ-026**: Store runtime state, deployment history, and health check results in SQLite
- **REQ-027**: Maintain audit trail of all deployment activities
- **REQ-028**: Persist application state across binary restarts

### 2.7 Observability
- **REQ-029**: Provide CLI commands for status checking and management
- **REQ-030**: Expose HTTP API for programmatic access to status and history
- **REQ-031**: Generate structured logs for all state changes
- **REQ-032**: Track deployment durations and success/failure rates

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- **NFR-001**: Handle concurrent deployments across multiple applications
- **NFR-002**: Minimize proxy latency overhead
- **NFR-003**: Support WebSocket connections without significant performance impact

### 3.2 Reliability
- **NFR-004**: Gracefully handle Docker daemon failures
- **NFR-005**: Recover application state from SQLite on restart
- **NFR-006**: Continue serving traffic during deployments
- **NFR-007**: Handle network interruptions during health checks

### 3.3 Security
- **NFR-008**: Listen only on localhost for management API (security through network isolation)
- **NFR-009**: Validate all configuration inputs
- **NFR-010**: No TLS termination required (handled upstream)

### 3.4 Maintainability
- **NFR-011**: Single binary deployment
- **NFR-012**: Minimal external dependencies
- **NFR-013**: Clear error messages and debugging information
- **NFR-014**: Human-readable configuration files

## 4. Constraints

### 4.1 Technical Constraints
- **CON-001**: Written in Go programming language
- **CON-002**: Use Docker API for container management
- **CON-003**: SQLite for data persistence (no external database)
- **CON-004**: Standard library + minimal external dependencies
- **CON-005**: Linux-based deployment environment

### 4.2 Operational Constraints
- **CON-006**: Multiple VMs in common network
- **CON-007**: Ansible-like configuration management
- **CON-008**: Integration with existing s3dock polling system
- **CON-009**: Open source tooling only

## 5. Out of Scope

### 5.1 Excluded Features
- **EXC-001**: Database migration coordination
- **EXC-002**: Manual approval workflows
- **EXC-003**: TLS certificate management
- **EXC-004**: Load balancer configuration
- **EXC-005**: Multi-VM orchestration
- **EXC-006**: Service mesh integration
- **EXC-007**: Kubernetes compatibility
